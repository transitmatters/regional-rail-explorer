# Regional Rail Explorer
![lint](https://github.com/transitmatters/regional-rail-explorer/workflows/lint/badge.svg)

The Regional Rail Explorer is a tool to demonstrate the impact of Regional Rail on journeys within the MBTA rail system. It uses real MBTA GTFS feeds and hypothetical equivalents generated by the [`regional-rail-schedule-generator`](https://github.com/transitmatters/regional-rail-schedule-generator) repository to simulate and compare journeys with today's Commuter Rail, and potential Regional Rail systems of tomorrow.

This project is in the early stages of development.

## Setup

To start the application locally:

```
npm install
export PORT=3000
npm run build && npm start
```
Then navigate to http://localhost:3000.

Initial API requests will be quite slow for now as the server must load and parse several large GTFS bundles.

## Storybook

An index of React component fixtures is available to browse by running:

```
npm run storybook
```

## Linting

To lint the project source code, run `npm run lint` in the root directory
