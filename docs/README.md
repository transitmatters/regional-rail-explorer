The Regional Rail Explorer is a tool to demonstrate the impact of Regional Rail on journeys within the MBTA rail system. It uses real MBTA GTFS feeds and hypothetical equivalents generated by the [`regional-rail-schedule-generator`](https://github.com/transitmatters/regional-rail-schedule-generator) repository to simulate and compare journeys with today's Commuter Rail, and potential Regional Rail systems of tomorrow.

This project is in the early stages of development.

## Setup
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
 - [`node`](https://nodejs.org/en/) `16.x`
 - [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com/)

### Local Deployment

```
npm install
export PORT=3000
npm run build && npm start
```
Then navigate to http://localhost:3000.

### Server Deployment
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- [nginx](https://www.nginx.com/)
- [supervisord](http://supervisord.org/introduction.html)

```
$ git pull
$ sudo cp devops/regional-rail-explorer-supervisor.conf /etc/supervisor/conf.d/regional-rail-explorer.conf
$ sudo cp devops/regional-rail-explorer-nginx.conf /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
$ sudo supervisorctl reload
$ sudo systemctl restart nginx
$ npm install
$ NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=2048" npm run build
$ sudo supervisorctl restart regional-rail-explorer
```

Initial API requests will be quite slow for now as the server must load and parse several large GTFS bundles.

#### Deploy changes with Ansible
You can deploy changes to this application on an AWS Lightsail instance running Ubuntu using the `deploy-on-lightsail.yaml` Ansible playbook.

To do so, install Ansible, create an inventory file, and run the playbook with your AWS Private Key in the same directory using the command below:

`$ ansible-playbook devops/deploy-on-lightsail.yml -i inventory --private-key aws_private_key.pem`

## Storybook

An index of React component fixtures is available to browse by running:

```
npm run storybook
```

## Linting

To lint the project source code, run `npm run lint` in the root directory
